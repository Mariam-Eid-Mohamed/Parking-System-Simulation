# Parking System Simulation

## Introduction
This project simulates a parking system using semaphores and threads in Java. The parking lot has a limited number of parking spots and three gates through which cars can enter. Each car arrives at a specific time, stays in the parking for a predetermined duration, and exits. The main challenge is to effectively manage parking spots among cars arriving at different gates using thread synchronization mechanisms.

## Objectives
- **Thread Synchronization**: Utilize threading and semaphores to manage access to the parking spots.
- **Concurrency Management**: Ensure that the system handles concurrent arrivals and departures without errors.
- **Simulation Realism**: Cars should arrive at specific times, and the simulation should reflect this timing accurately.
- **Status Reporting**: Implement a feature to report the number of cars currently parked and the total number of cars served over time.

## System Specifications
- **Parking Spots**: 4 spots available in total.
- **Gates**: 3 gates (Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3).
- **Car Arrival**: Each gate will receive cars at different times, specified as per the arrival schedule.

## Tasks
1. **Setup Parking Lot**: Create a parking lot with 4 parking spots.
2. **Implement Gates**: Simulate car arrivals at three different gates using separate threads.
3. **Car Threads**: Each car is represented by a thread that attempts to enter the parking lot.
4. **Semaphores**: Use semaphores to manage parking spot availability.
5. **Logging and Reporting**: Log the activity of each car and report the number of cars currently in the parking and the total served once the simulation ends.

## Implementation Details
- **Thread Function**: Each carâ€™s thread will attempt to acquire a parking spot, stay for its duration, and then release the spot.
- **Arrival Times**: Use `sleep()` to simulate arrival times.
- **Duration in Parking**: Use `sleep()` to simulate the duration for which each car stays in the parking lot.
- **Concurrency Control**: Use a semaphore to manage the parking spots and ensure there are no race conditions.
- **Input**: Arrival times and durations are read and parsed from a text file.

## Usage
To run the simulation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Java installed.
3. Compile the Java files.
4. Run the main class.
